Last month I wrote [a post on geographic polarization in US presidential elections](http://www.kevinyaro.ch/2016/06/20/state-presidential-vote-dispersion/).
In this post, I defined geographic polarization as "the extent to which US
states differ from each other with respect to voting behavior in presidential
elections," and attempted to quantify this using various statistical measures.

All three measures we tried showed a similar basic pattern. There was a period of
high polarization from the 1890s to the 1940s, roughly corresponding to the
Third and Fourth Party systems, followed by a period of low polarization from
1950s to the 1980s, then increasing polarization from the 1990s to the present.
However, the relative levels we saw were rather different in each case:

* In terms of **variance**, polarization in recent elections is *lower* than it
was in the first half of the twentieth century.
* In terms of **median absolute deviation**, polarization in recent elections is
*about the same* as it was in the first half of the twentieth century.
* In terms of **interquartile distance**, polarization in recent elections is
*higher* than it was in the first half of the twentieth century.
