### Who are you?

My name is Kevin Yaroch. I live in Chicago and telecommute to California.

### What is your job?

I develop web applications for my company's intranet. Among other things, these
websites compile some of the information used in the [HE BGP Toolkit](http://bgp.he.net/).
My duties have varied over the years and sometimes also include Linux system
administration and support for colocation and IP transit customers.

### What technologies do you know how to use?

I have a reasonably in-depth knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and SQL, and some
knowledge of Python and JavaScript. I also have TCP/IP networking experience,
and a variety of other miscellaneous IT experience I've acquired over the years.

Many, including:

* Mapping ([here are some maps I've made](https://kjyaroch.cartodb.com/maps))
